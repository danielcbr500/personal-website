                        Hi! I am Daniel Ahmed and this is my personal website that I created over a weekend of boredom in the summer.
                        I decided to try learning html for fun and as a result I decided to create
                        my own website which also serves as a tool for future employers to get a glimpse of who I am. This website is constantly being updated as I continue to grow my skills.
                        <br><br>

                        Where Am I From? I was born and raised in Saddle Brook, New Jersey. After enrolling into college I moved to Jersey City. 
                        My parents immigrated here from Pakistan in the 80's and raised me and my siblings in North Jersey. <br><br>


                        Two weeks after graduating from Saddle Brook High School, I left for basic military training in San Antonio, Texas where I began my journey in the United States Air Force. After returning from technical training I 
                         was put on active duty orders for an extended period of time. During this time, I managed to get my associate's degree in natural sciences and mathematics from Bergen Community College. After returning to tradional reservists status, I enrolled into Rutgers University School of Arts and Sciences located in New Brunswick, NJ. I am currently majoring in computer science with a minor in mathematics with a projected graduation date of May 2026. 
                            <br><br>

                            In my free time I also serve as a volunteer firefighter and have gone through multiple courses for firefighting receiving certifications from Bergen County Fire Academy. I 
have been a volunteer for the past 3 years and enjoy everything involved within the fire service from fighting fires to doing community outreach programs. Besides the fire department I also volunteer for a local boys muslim youth group
where I am able to help mentor the youth growing up in America with school, identity, and many different issues confronting them. 

Some of my favorite pastimes include going to the gym, hiking/exploring nature, and watching the UFC.
